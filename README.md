# BattleBoats

This website was made based on the curriculum of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/home) Javascript section. BattleBoats is made entirely with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and vanilla Javascript. Battleboats was made to emphesize the importance of adopting TDD practices early on in a project and using them to drive further development. Battleboats was my first foray into creating a computer "AI" of sorts that is both intuitive but also fair.

## Learning Objectives

- Further my knowledge of [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and usage of vanilla Javascipt class syntax.
- Develop a better understanding of TDD best practices and gain further familiarity with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
- Write my own "AI" for the computer component that is actually pretty darn competent at playing the game.
- Implement drag and drop functionality that works in an almost 1:1 ratio for where pieces should be placed.
- Further develop my design and creative abilities to create and adhere to a certain aethetic or theme that is utilized throughout the project.
- Write all my own CSS and don't utilize any frameworks to help with responsive layout or overall design.
- Make a website more responsive to various viewports.
- Make my code more modular and partitioned overall.
