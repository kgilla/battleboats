# BattleBoats

This website was made based on the curriculum of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/home) Javascript section. BattleBoats is made entirely with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and vanilla Javascript. 4-Cast utilizes [Open Weather's](https://openweathermap.org/api) amazing One Call API to deliver a large chunk of weather data per API call. To facilitate these API calls, 4-Cast features a self-rolled search system which helps match the desired city and country based on your input and retreive said cities coordinates.
